## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [SmartKirana](https://github.com/mayank1327/smartkirana-backend) - Multi-Unit Inventory Management System
*Live system built for kirana shops with real-world complexity*

**Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT

**Key Features**:
- Multi-unit product hierarchy (Piece → Packet → Carton) with automatic conversion
